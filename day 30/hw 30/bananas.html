        <p><strong>Tesla, Inc.</strong> is an American multinational <b>automotive</b> and <b>clean energy</b><br> company headquartered in <b>Austin, Texas,</b> which designs, manufactures and sells <b>battery electric vehicles,</b><br> stationary battery <b>energy storage</b> devices from home to <b>grid-scale, solar panels</b> and <b>solar shingles,</b><br> and related products and services. <br><br>
            Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by <b>Martin Eberhard</b> and <b>Marc Tarpenning</b> as <strong>Tesla Motors.</strong> The <br> company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer <strong>Nikola Tesla.</strong> In February 2004, <strong>Elon Musk</strong> <br>joined as the company's largest shareholder and in 2008 he was named <b>CEO.</b> In 2008, the company <br> began production of its first car model, the <b>Roadster</b> sports car, followed by the <b>Model S</b> sedan in 2012, the <br><b>Model X</b> SUV in 2015, the <b>Model 3</b> sedan in 2017, the <b>Model Y</b> crossover in 2020, the <b>Tesla Semi</b> truck in <br>2022 and the <b>Cybertruck</b> pickup truck in 2023. The Model 3 is the all-time bestselling <b>plug-in electric car</b><br> worldwide, and in June 2021 became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.<sup><b>[6]</b></sup> In 2023, the <br>Model Y was the best-selling vehicle, of any kind, globally<sup><b>[3]</b></sup><br><br>
            Tesla is one of the <b>world's most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization.</b> In October 2021, <br>Tesla's market capitalization temporarily reached <b>US$</b>1 trillion, the sixth company to do so in U.S. history. In <br>2023, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 19.9% share. Also in 2023, the company <br>was ranked 69th in the <b>Forbes Global 2000.<sup>[7]</sup></b> As of March 2024, it is the world's most valuable automaker. <br><br>
            Tesla has been the subject of lawsuits, government scrutiny, and journalistic <b>criticism, </b>stemming from <br>allegations of <b>whistleblower</b> retaliation, <b>worker rights violations,</b> product defects, and Musk's many <br>controversial statements.</p><br>
